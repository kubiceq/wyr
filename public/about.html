        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        My name is Kubqo and I created this website for you.
        <p>
            I'm a technology student from Slovakia and I found myself stuck at home during corona pandemic.
            Trying to replicate the world before the covid hit, my wife-to-be created a small discord channel for us and our friends. There, we could watch movies, play games and drink beer together.
        </p>
        <p>
            We love to play board games together, but there is such a small number of them that we could play online!
        </p>
        <p>
            With a lot of free time and a never ending lockdown, I set out to create a simple website where me and my friends could play silly card games together.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few sleepless nights and a bottle of rum... Tadaa! Here is the result! I hope that this personal project will bring a little joy to your life in these daring times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, I am writing this with hope that you can give me some money. The cost of running this page isn't much, but it would help me a lot. It would also show your support which I'm grateful for. Hope you spend some sleepless night here and enjoy them like we do.
        </p>
        <p></p>
